Main Photographic Sights
The route offers diverse photographic opportunities, from Colorado's unique geological formations to Kansas's expansive prairie art and historical landmarks.

Colorado:

Garden of the Gods (Colorado Springs): This national natural landmark features stunning red rock formations that provide dramatic photographic backdrops. While specific RV parking details are not provided, large tourist attractions often have provisions for oversized vehicles.

Red Rocks Park and Amphitheatre (Morrison, near Denver): Known for its iconic geological formations and as a world-renowned outdoor concert venue. For RVs, parking is designated in Lower South Lot 2, and overnight parking is not permitted.

Denver Botanic Gardens (Denver): A significant botanical garden offering diverse plant collections. However, RVs are explicitly prohibited from the parking complex due to weight restrictions, and vans should use the top deck due to height limits. This necessitates alternative parking arrangements or public transport when visiting.

Kansas:

Giant Van Gogh Painting (Goodland): A large-scale depiction of sunflowers on a giant easel, located near I-70 Exit 19. This roadside attraction offers a quick, fun photo opportunity and a convenient break.

Wheat Jesus Billboard (Goodland): Visible from I-70 as travelers pass through Goodland, this billboard depicting Jesus in a wheat field is a unique point of interest, though not a designated stop for photography.

Monument Rocks (Oakley): These striking chalk formations, also known as the Chalk Pyramids, resemble a castle on the prairie. They are located on private land but are open during daylight hours for visitors. Crucially, overnight camping or RV parking is not allowed directly at the site. Travelers planning to visit should arrange overnight stays at nearby RV parks like High Plains Camping in Oakley.

Little Jerusalem Badlands State Park (Logan County): This state park showcases a unique landscape of chalk formations resembling small canyons. It offers hiking trails and scenic overlooks and provides ample RV parking, including space for turning around. It is a day-use-only park, with no camping permitted.

Smoky Hills Wind Farm (Marquette): This expansive wind farm is particularly impressive for photography after dark when the flashing red lights of the turbines create an awe-inspiring and eerie visual.

Mushroom Rock State Park (Carneiro/Marquette): Characterized by unique mushroom-shaped rock formations, this state park is designated as a day-use area only. Camping and RV parking are not permitted directly within the park.

Coronado Heights (Lindsborg): A castle-like structure offering panoramic views of the surrounding countryside, ideal for picnics and capturing sunsets. RV parking is available at the Coronado Motel and RV Park in Lindsborg, which charges fees for RV/bus/truck parking.

Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve (Strong City): This preserve protects a vast expanse of the iconic Flint Hills prairie, featuring hiking trails and a bison herd. While a significant photographic destination, overnight camping is not allowed within the preserve itself. Travelers must seek nearby RV parks, such as Emporia RV Park and Campground, for overnight stays.

Brewpubs & Other Tourist Attractions
Beyond natural and historical sights, the route offers opportunities to experience local culture through brewpubs and other attractions.

Colorado:

Tommyknocker Brewery (Idaho Springs): A recommended brewery located near I-70. Downtown Idaho Springs has paid parking, with some 3-hour free zones, but overnight parking or camping is not permitted. This indicates that a stop for a brew and meal is feasible, but the RV would need to be moved to an approved overnight location afterward.

Great Divide Brewery & Roadhouse (Denver area): This brewery has multiple locations, including Castle Rock, Lone Tree, and Belmar (Lakewood), offering craft beer and food. While "convenient parking" is mentioned, specific RV parking accommodations are not detailed, suggesting standard parking lots that may or may not easily accommodate a 20-foot RV. This highlights a general observation in urban areas where specialized RV parking is rare, often requiring drivers to scout for larger spaces or rely on public transport from a more RV-friendly periphery.

Ratio Beerworks (Denver): Situated in Denver's RiNo (River North) district, this brewery is also close to I-70. Similar to other urban breweries, specific RV parking is not mentioned, implying that standard street or lot parking would be the primary option. Navigating and parking a 20-foot Class B RV in dense urban environments like downtown Denver can be challenging due to limited space and height restrictions in garages. This implies that travelers might consider using ride-sharing services or public transportation from a peripheral RV park to access these urban attractions.

Kansas:

Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum & Boyhood Home (Abilene): A significant historical stop dedicated to Dwight D. Eisenhower. This site offers dedicated bus/RV parking in its south lot, making it highly accessible for RV travelers.

Flint Hills Discovery Center (Manhattan): This center provides an educational experience about the unique Kansas Flint Hills region. Parking is free and available in the main zoo lot, but overnight parking is strictly prohibited. For overnight stays, nearby RV parks such as Basecamp Flint Hills in Council Grove offer suitable RV sites.

Sternberg Museum of Natural History (Hays): This museum offers bus and RV parking on its east side, a short walk from the main entrance, ensuring convenient access for RV visitors.

Rolling Hills Zoo (Salina): RV parking for this attraction is available nearby at Sundown RV Park, which is conveniently located minutes from Salina and directly off I-70 Exit 244.

National World War I Museum and Memorial (Kansas City): This prominent museum offers free parking, including accessible parking spaces, located on its south side in the U-shaped drive and West Visitors Lot.

Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art (Kansas City): Located near the Country Club Plaza. The Plaza itself offers free parking in garages and street parking, though overnight parking in garages is reserved for paid monthly parkers. A nearby campground also notes its proximity to the museum, suggesting it as a potential base for exploration.

Country Club Plaza (Kansas City): A well-known district for shopping and dining. It provides free parking in garages and on the street, but overnight parking in garages is generally not available for non-monthly parkers.

Boulevard Brewing Co. (Kansas City, MO): Recognized as the largest specialty brewer in the Midwest. The Tours & Rec Center offers "convenient parking" for visitors. While not explicitly stating RV parking, the term "convenient parking" for a brewery of this scale suggests a likelihood of accommodating a 20-foot Class B RV in their lots.

Martin City Brewing Company (Kansas City, MO): With several locations, including a Pizza & Taproom + Brewery, this establishment explicitly states "ample free parking, streetside and across the road in our adjacent parking lot". This is a clear indicator that a 20-foot Class B RV should find suitable parking here.

III. Leg 2: Gateway to the East Coast (Kansas City, KS to St. Louis, MO)
This segment of the journey connects the two major metropolitan areas of Missouri, serving as a transitional phase from the Great Plains to the eastern states. The direct driving distance from Kansas City to St. Louis is approximately 241 to 243 miles, with a driving time of about 4 hours. While this distance could theoretically be covered in a single day within the 4-8 hour driving limit, breaking it into two shorter days allows for more leisurely exploration and adherence to the daily driving preference, especially if scenic routes are chosen.

Route Overview & Daily Breakdown
The primary route for this leg is I-70 East. However, for a more scenic experience, alternatives such as Highway 50 or Highways 94 and 100 along the Missouri River are available, though these may extend the travel time. The decision to opt for a faster, direct route (I-70) or a more scenic, slightly longer route depends on the traveler's preference for efficiency versus a more immersive experience. This highlights a common trade-off in road trip planning, where time savings on major interstates can be weighed against the unique charm and photographic opportunities of alternative routes.

Day 4: Kansas City, KS to Central Missouri

Travel from Kansas City eastward. Travelers can choose I-70 for efficiency or take US-50 for a more iconic drive through the Missouri heartland, known for its landscapes. A suitable midpoint for an overnight stop would be around Columbia, MO, which is approximately 125 miles from Kansas City.

Day 5: Central Missouri to St. Louis, MO

Continue the journey to St. Louis. From central Missouri, travelers can rejoin I-70 or explore Highways 94 and 100, which follow the Missouri River and offer scenic views into St. Louis.

Navigating New York City in a Class B RV
Navigating New York City with a 20-foot Class B RV presents unique challenges, primarily due to height restrictions on parkways, tunnels, and bridges, as well as general urban parking limitations.

Height Restrictions on Parkways, Tunnels, and Bridges:

New York and Connecticut parkways are known to have general height restrictions, often posted as "No vehicles over 7'10"". A significant concern is that overpasses on these parkways can be lower than the posted limits, and there may not be an exit ramp available before encountering such a low clearance. This poses a direct hazard for RVs, even a 20-foot Class B, which can exceed these limits.

MTA Bridges and Tunnels, which provide critical access into and around New York City, also impose height limits. For instance, the Queens Midtown Tunnel and Hugh L. Carey Tunnel have a 12 ft 1 in limit, while the Henry Hudson Bridge has a 12 ft limit and explicitly prohibits trucks. The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge has higher clearances but still requires adherence to regulations.

Port Authority of New York & New Jersey crossings, including the Lincoln Tunnel, Holland Tunnel, and George Washington Bridge, also have specific height restrictions (e.g., Lincoln Tunnel 13 ft, Holland Tunnel 12 ft 6 in). Many of these crossings also prohibit commercial vehicles or trailers, and while a Class B RV might be registered as a "passenger" vehicle in New York, its height can still subject it to these restrictions. These restrictions are critical for safety and avoiding significant fines. The implication is that attempting to drive a 20-foot Class B RV directly into Manhattan or through certain scenic parkways can be highly problematic and potentially dangerous.

Recommended RV Parking Strategies Outside Manhattan with Public Transport Access:

Given the significant challenges of driving and parking a 20-foot RV directly within Manhattan, the most practical and recommended strategy is to park the RV at a dedicated RV park outside the city and utilize public transportation for urban exploration. This approach mitigates the risks associated with height restrictions, narrow streets, and the scarcity of suitable parking.

Liberty Harbor RV Park (Jersey City, NJ): This is identified as the closest RV park to New York City. It offers 50 sites with water and electric hookups, a dump station, full restrooms with hot showers, and an on-site restaurant/bar. Crucially, it provides easy access to Manhattan via the PATH train, ferries (NY Waterway Ferry to Wall Street), and the Hudson Bergen Light Rail. This park exemplifies the "park and ride" strategy, offering a secure base with amenities while allowing convenient city access.

Skyline RV Camp (Jersey City, NJ): Also minutes from Manhattan, this camp offers convenient access to public transportation, including the NYC Ferry, for exploring the city.

Camp Gateway-Brooklyn NY (Floyd Bennett Field, Brooklyn): This location offers RV camping. Public transportation via the Q35 bus can transport visitors to the campground, and seasonal ferry rides from Riis Landing provide access to Manhattan. RV campers should review specific driving directions provided by the park to ensure smooth access and avoid potential issues. The availability of these dedicated RV parks with direct public transportation links underscores that the most effective way to experience New York City with a Class B RV is to avoid urban driving and parking altogether.

V. Leg 4: City to Coastal Wilderness (New York City, NY to Acadia National Park, ME)
This final leg of the journey transitions from the urban sprawl of New York City to the rugged coastal beauty of Acadia National Park in Maine. The direct driving distance is approximately 489 miles, requiring about 8 to 9 hours of continuous driving. To adhere to the 4-8 hour daily driving limit, this segment will be broken into three distinct travel days, primarily utilizing I-95 North along the scenic coastal route. This choice prioritizes efficiency while still offering access to numerous attractions along the way.

Route Overview & Daily Breakdown
The primary route for this leg is the Coastal Route, which follows Interstate 95 North through Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and into Maine. While a Mountain Route through Vermont is an alternative, it adds approximately 2-3 hours to the direct driving time, making the Coastal Route more suitable for maintaining the daily driving limits. This decision reflects a strategic choice to balance travel time with the desire for exploration, acknowledging that the most direct route often facilitates more stops within daily driving constraints.

Day 11: New York City, NY to Mystic, CT Area

The initial drive from NYC to the Mystic, CT area via I-95 North is approximately 134 miles, taking about 2.5 to 3 hours. This short travel day allows for a relaxed start after the urban experience and provides ample time to explore Mystic.

Day 12: Mystic, CT Area to Portland, ME Area

Continuing on I-95 North from Mystic, CT, to Portland, ME, covers approximately 200 miles, with an estimated driving time of about 3.5 to 4 hours. Portland serves as an excellent intermediate stop with its vibrant coastal atmosphere.

Day 13: Portland, ME Area to Acadia National Park, ME

The final drive from Portland, ME, to Acadia National Park is approximately 160 to 170 miles, taking roughly 3 hours. This allows for arrival at Acadia with sufficient time to settle in and begin initial explorations.

Overnight Stops (State Parks, KOAs, Rest Stops)
Identifying suitable RV-friendly overnight accommodations along the East Coast is critical for this final leg. The 20-foot Class B RV's relatively small size provides broad compatibility with most standard RV sites, reducing the need for extensive length-specific checks at each potential stop.

Salem Witch Museum (Salem): A popular tourist destination. RVs and oversized vehicles can find parking at Shetland Park/Prime Storage for a fee of $60. This provides a practical solution for visiting this historical site with an RV.

Boston (Skyline Views): Offers impressive harbor and city skyline views. RV parking in Boston for oversized vehicles can be challenging due to height restrictions in many garages and limited large spaces. Open-air lots or MBTA (public transit) lots/garages are potential options, but direct contact with parking facilities is recommended to confirm clearance and space availability.

Park Loop Drive: This scenic drive offers stunning views throughout the park. Most vehicles, including a 20-foot Class B RV, can navigate the main route through the park.

A key consideration for exploring Acadia National Park is the availability of the free Island Explorer shuttle service, which operates from June through October. This shuttle serves various park destinations and campgrounds, including those friendly to RVs, allowing travelers to explore the park without the need to constantly move their RV or worry about parking at popular spots within the park. This strategy optimizes park enjoyment by minimizing RV driving within the park.

RV Parking within Bar Harbor Downtown: Bar Harbor offers designated RV parking spaces for large vehicles at $2.00/hour, with free parking available during the winter season (November 1 - May 14).

Acadia National Park RV Access
Acadia National Park is the final destination, offering a unique blend of coastal and forested environments. Accessing and exploring the park with a 20-foot Class B RV involves specific considerations regarding vehicle length, hookups, and internal park transportation.

RV Length Restrictions:

Acadia National Park campgrounds, including Blackwoods and Seawall, can accommodate RVs up to 35 feet long. Schoodic Woods Campground, located on the mainland, is even more accommodating, welcoming rigs up to 45 feet long. A 20-foot Class B RV falls well within these limits, ensuring excellent access to all park campgrounds. The maneuverability of a Class B RV is a significant advantage in national parks, where larger rigs often face restrictions.

Hookups:

Blackwoods Campground: Sites are primarily dry camping, meaning they are not equipped with hookups. However, essential amenities such as bathrooms, a water pump, and a dump station are available.

Schoodic Woods Campground: This is a notable exception within the park system, as it offers electric hookups at every RV site and water at some. A dump station is also available. This campground is the only RV-friendly option within Acadia National Park that provides water and power hookups.

Seawall Campground: Similar to Blackwoods, sites are dry camping (no hookups), but flush toilets, running water, and a dump station are provided. Pay showers are available from private vendors less than a mile away. It is noted that maneuvering RVs into this campground can be challenging.

Commercial Campgrounds (near Acadia): Several commercial campgrounds near Acadia National Park offer full hookups. Bar Harbor Campground provides 30 and 50 AMP hookups, a heated pool, and hot showers. Smuggler's Den Campground offers full hookups (20, 30, and 50 AMP with water and sewer) on paved pads for RVs up to 45 feet. KOA campgrounds in the area, such as Bar Harbor / Oceanside KOA, Bar Harbor / Woodlands KOA, and Bangor / Holden KOA, also offer full hookups.

Island Explorer Shuttle Access:

The free Island Explorer shuttle service operates from June through October, providing a highly convenient way to explore the park. It serves nine routes with regular stops throughout the park, including Blackwoods Campground, Schoodic Woods Campground, and Bar Harbor / Oceanside KOA. This service is an excellent resource for minimizing RV driving within the park, allowing travelers to leave their RV at the campground and access popular destinations without parking concerns. It is important to note that Cadillac Summit Road is not served by the Island Explorer.

RV Parking within Bar Harbor Downtown:

Bar Harbor offers designated RV parking for large vehicles at a rate of $2.00 per hour during the peak season (May 15 - October 30). During the winter season (November 1 - May 14), parking is free. The Eden Street Lot specifically allows RVs and offers free parking, though it is located slightly outside the immediate downtown area. This provides practical options for accessing the town's amenities.

Strategic Campground Selection for Acadia Exploration:

The availability of both National Park campgrounds and commercial RV parks near Acadia National Park presents a strategic decision point for travelers. National Park campgrounds (Blackwoods, Seawall, Schoodic Woods) offer varying levels of hookups, with Schoodic Woods being the only one with electric and water. Commercial options generally provide more comprehensive full hookups. The Island Explorer shuttle is a critical amenity for exploring the park, as it provides convenient access from many campgrounds to park attractions. Therefore, the choice of base camp should align with the traveler's priorities: if full hookups are essential, a commercial campground might be preferred. If direct immersion in the park's natural setting is paramount, a National Park campground, even with fewer amenities, combined with extensive use of the shuttle, would be ideal. This decision-making process allows travelers to tailor their Acadia experience to their specific needs and preferences.

VI. Essential RV Road Trip Tips
Successful execution of a multi-leg RV expedition requires meticulous planning and adherence to best practices for RV operation and safety.

RV Parking Best Practices: General Tips for Class B RVs at Attractions and Campgrounds
The 20-foot Class B RV is celebrated for its nimbleness and ease of driving compared to larger motorhomes, often allowing it to park comfortably in average parking lots. However, proactive parking management remains crucial.

Understanding Dimensions: Prior to any maneuver, it is imperative to know the exact length, width, and height of the RV, including any rooftop components or extended awnings. This knowledge is fundamental for assessing the suitability of a parking spot and avoiding potential obstacles such as low-hanging branches or overhead structures. Even a 20-foot Class B can encounter issues with very low bridges or tight urban clearances.

Scouting Parking: When approaching any attraction or campground, it is advisable to scout the parking area in advance. Prioritize designated RV parking spaces, pull-through sites, or large, open lots. Actively avoid narrow streets, sharp turns, and areas with limited maneuvering space. For urban attractions, checking their websites or calling ahead for specific RV parking instructions is highly recommended.

Slow and Steady: Patience is a virtue in RV parking. Approach all spots slowly and cautiously, taking wide turns to accommodate the vehicle's length. Small, deliberate adjustments are far more effective than sudden movements, which can lead to errors or damage.

Spotter/Backup Camera: A spotter is an invaluable asset when backing up an RV. Clear communication, ideally through walkie-talkies, is essential to avoid shouting and ensure precise guidance. While a backup camera provides additional visibility, it should never be the sole reliance for parking maneuvers; the spotter's direct view and the RV's large side mirrors are indispensable.

Leveling: Upon parking at a campsite, selecting a relatively level spot is important for comfort and proper functioning of RV appliances. If the site is uneven, leveling blocks should be strategically placed under the wheels to achieve a stable and level position.

Overnight Parking: Always confirm and adhere to specific overnight parking rules, especially at rest stops, retail parking lots (e.g., Walmart or Cracker Barrel), or public areas. Permission is often required, and ignoring posted regulations can lead to fines or towing.

The consistent need for proactive parking management throughout the journey highlights a fundamental aspect of successful RV travel. Understanding the RV's capabilities and limitations, combined with diligent pre-arrival checks and careful maneuvering, significantly reduces stress and enhances the overall enjoyment of the trip.

Pre-Trip RV Maintenance Checklist
Prior to embarking on a long cross-country journey, a thorough RV maintenance check is non-negotiable to prevent unexpected issues.

Fluid Levels and Tires: Ensure all engine fluid levels (oil, coolant, brake fluid, power steering fluid) are at optimal levels. Inspect all tires, including the spare, for proper inflation, tread wear, and any signs of damage. Correct tire pressure is critical for safety and fuel efficiency.

Brakes: Have the braking system inspected to confirm proper function and adequate pad life.

RV Systems Check: Test all onboard RV systems. This includes the plumbing (water pump, toilet, freshwater and wastewater tanks), electrical system (shore power connection, house batteries, inverter, and generator if applicable), and all appliances (refrigerator, stove, microwave, air conditioning, and heating units).

Exterior Inspection: Inspect and clean the RV roof, paying close attention to seals around vents, skylights, and seams to prevent leaks. Check the condition and operation of awnings.

Safety Equipment: Verify that all safety equipment is functional, including smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, and fire extinguishers. Ensure the fire extinguisher is fully charged and easily accessible.

Packing Essentials for a Long RV Journey
Strategic packing contributes significantly to comfort and preparedness on an extended RV trip.

Tools and Spares: A basic toolkit, including a tire repair kit, assorted fuses, and duct tape, can address minor issues on the road.

Safety and Emergency Supplies: A comprehensive first-aid kit, emergency roadside flares or triangles, and a robust emergency kit (e.g., jumper cables, flashlight, basic recovery gear) are essential.

Navigation: While GPS with RV-specific routing capabilities is highly recommended to avoid restricted roads and low clearances, carrying physical maps provides a reliable backup in areas with poor signal.

Provisions: Adequate non-perishable food items and a sufficient supply of potable water are crucial, especially when traveling through remote areas or opting for primitive camping. Cooking essentials should also be readily accessible.

Outdoor Gear: Portable chairs, an outdoor table, lighting, and insect repellent enhance comfort at campsites.

Entertainment: Books, board games, and downloaded movies or music provide entertainment during downtime or inclement weather.

Road Safety and Emergency Preparedness
Prioritizing road safety and being prepared for unforeseen circumstances are paramount for a successful RV trip.

Route Planning: Thoroughly plan each day's route, taking into account road conditions, forecasted weather, and potential construction zones.

Height and Weight Restrictions: Pay particular attention to posted height and weight restrictions, especially when approaching parkways, tunnels, and bridges in urban areas like New York City. An RV-specific GPS can be invaluable for avoiding prohibited routes.

Driver Fatigue: Adhere strictly to the recommended 4-8 hours of daily driving and take regular breaks to combat fatigue. Driver alertness is critical for RV safety.

Roadside Assistance: Have contact information for roadside assistance readily available.

Campground Rules: Familiarize oneself with specific campground rules regarding generator usage times and pet policies to ensure a harmonious stay with other campers and compliance with regulations.

VII. Conclusion
This comprehensive itinerary demonstrates the feasibility and richness of a cross-continental RV expedition from Steamboat Springs, Colorado, to Acadia National Park, Maine, utilizing a 20-foot Class B motorhome. The vehicle's inherent blend of comfort and maneuverability proves exceptionally well-suited for navigating diverse terrains, from mountainous regions and expansive prairies to bustling urban centers and serene coastal wilderness.

The detailed daily breakdowns, coupled with identified RV-friendly overnight stops in state parks, KOA campgrounds, and designated rest areas, ensure adherence to the preferred 4-8 hour daily driving limits. The analysis of photographic sights, brewpubs, and other tourist attractions, along with specific RV parking considerations, provides a practical framework for maximizing exploration at each stop.

The challenges associated with urban driving, particularly in New York City, are mitigated by the strategic recommendation to utilize peripheral RV parks with robust public transportation access, thereby transforming a potential logistical hurdle into a seamless urban experience. Furthermore, the emphasis on proactive RV parking management, adherence to height restrictions, and comprehensive pre-trip maintenance underscores the importance of preparedness for a successful journey.

Ultimately, this expedition offers a unique opportunity for immersive travel, blending natural discovery with cultural engagement across the diverse landscapes of the United States. Careful planning and attention to the RV-specific considerations outlined in this report will undoubtedly contribute to a memorable and seamless adventure from the heart of the Rockies to the rugged coast of Maine.
